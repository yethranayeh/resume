				"title": "Software Development Assistant",
				"period": { "start": "July 25, 2022" },
				"description": "I work in the development of the company's React-based B2B web applications. I am currently leading the software development efforts of our company's UI Kit project. The work environment consists of Figma designs by the UI/UX team and a Jira Sprint managed by product owners. Within this agile workflow, I participated in many projects and contributed heavily to Etstur's frontend modernization efforts. I also wrote documentation articles on our Confluence Wiki platform to share information about the projects I participated in. I am also a front-end representative in the in-house team called 'DevOps Heroes' and I regularly attend weekly meetings to keep up to date with DevOps processes.",
				"role": {
					"1": {
						"project": "UI Kit",
						"description": "I am the leading developer in converting standardized UI Kit designs on Figma from the UI/UX team into React components for use in all modern projects within the company. In addition to the React-based component library, I wrote a CLI tool that facilitates integration into internal projects. I structured the UI Kit project as a monorepo and simplified the development process by linking the CLI and UI Kit libraries by utilizing yarn's 'workspaces' feature."

						"project": "E-mail Template",
						"description": "I created this project to standardize emails sent to users by Etstur, starting with 'Etspartners,' and integrated it into the current email process. With the CLI script I wrote, email changes are quickly and automatically deployed to Mandrill. Initially developed with 'mjml-react,' I later updated the project to use 'react-email' to reduce maintenance costs and increase usability."

						"project": "Digital Contract",
						"description": "This project was requested by Etstur's contract team to digitize hotel contracts and track contract processes. I took responsibility for the 'Digital Contract' project as the sole front-end developer from the beginning to live deployment. From April 2023, all resort hotels began managing contract details and documents through the Digital Contract. The project was featured as 'Product of the Month' in Etstur's Monthly Technology Bulletin. After the project went live, I supported the handover and maintenance to the new front-end team."
					},
					"5": {
						"project": "B2B Boilerplate",
						"description": "I created a boilerplate project to quickly set up B2B React projects. After laying the foundation with 'Etspartners,' I compiled the technologies, code standards, and project structure we might need for other B2B projects and made them reusable in the boilerplate."
					},
					"6": {
						"project": "etspartners.com",
						"description": "The modernized version of Etstur's B2B dashboard application for our partnered hotels. Rewritten using React and Java Spring Boot.
